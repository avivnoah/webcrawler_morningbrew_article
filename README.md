#This is still in progress, I "just" want to: 1. Store the data in a database, sorted by: 'read', 'favorite', etc, with links, to store data with links next to it so i wouldn't need to load all articles every time, 2. finish learning NLP before implementing the last step which utilizes an ML model i'll build to filter out content for me
